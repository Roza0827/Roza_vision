A dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes. `Fashion-MNIST` is intended to serve as a direct **drop-in replacement** of the original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) for benchmarking machine learning algorithms.

Here is an example how the data looks like (*each class takes three-rows*):

## Why?

The original [MNIST dataset](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/) contains a lot of handwritten digits. People from AI/ML/Data Science community love this dataset and use it as a benchmark to validate their algorithms. In fact, MNIST is often the first dataset they would try on. *"If it doesn't work on MNIST, it **won't work** at all"*, they said. *"Well, if it does work on MNIST, it may still fail on others."* 

`Fashion-MNIST` is intended to serve as a direct drop-in replacement for the original MNIST dataset to benchmark machine learning algorithms, as it shares the same image size and the structure of training and testing splits.

### To Serious Machine Learning Researchers

Seriously, we are talking about replacing MNIST. Here are some good reasons:

- MNIST is too easy. Check out [our side-by-side benchmark](http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/) and ["Most pairs of MNIST digits can be distinguished pretty well by just one pixel"](https://gist.github.com/dgrtwo/aaef94ecc6a60cd50322c0054cc04478)
- MNIST is overused. Check out ["Ian Goodfellow wants people to move away from mnist"](https://twitter.com/goodfellow_ian/status/852591106655043584)
- MNIST can not represent modern CV tasks. Check out ["Ideas on MNIST do not transfer to real CV"](https://twitter.com/fchollet/status/852592598128615424)

## Get the Data

You can use direct links to download the the dataset. The data is stored in the **same** format as the original [MNIST data](http://yann.lecun.com/exdb/mnist/).

| Name  | Content | Examples | Size | Link
| --- | --- |--- | --- |--- |
| `train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz`  | training set images  | 60,000|26 MBytes | [Download](http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/train-images-idx3-ubyte.gz)|
| `train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz`  | training set labels  |60,000|29 KBytes | [Download](http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/train-labels-idx1-ubyte.gz)|
| `t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz`  | test set images  | 10,000|4.2 MBytes | [Download](http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/t10k-images-idx3-ubyte.gz)|

Or you can clone this repository, the dataset is under `data/fashion`. This repo contains some scripts for benchmark and visualization.
   
```bash
git clone git@github.com:zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist.git
```

### Labels
Each training and test example is assigned to one of the following labels:

| Label | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0 | T-shirt/top |
| 1 | Trouser |
| 2 | Pullover |
| 3 | Dress |
| 4 | Coat |
| 5 | Sandal |
| 6 | Shirt |
| 7 | Sneaker |
| 8 | Bag |
| 9 | Ankle boot |

## Usage

### Loading data with Python (`numpy` is required)
- use `utils/mnist_reader` in this repo:
```python
import mnist_reader
X_train, y_train = mnist_reader.load_mnist('data/fashion', kind='train')
X_test, y_test = mnist_reader.load_mnist('data/fashion', kind='t10k')
```

### Loading data with Tensorflow
```python
from tensorflow.examples.tutorials.mnist import input_data
data = input_data.read_data_sets('data/fashion')

data.train.next_batch(100)
```

### Loading data with other languages

As one of the most popular dataset in the Machine Learning community, people have implemented MNIST loader in many languages. They can be used to load `Fashion-MNIST` dataset as well (may require decompressing first). Note that they are not tested by us.

## Benchmark
We build an automatic benchmarking system based on `scikit-learn`, covering 125 classifiers with different parameters. [Results can be found here.](http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/)

<img src="doc/img/benchmark.gif" width="100%">

You can reproduce the results by running `benchmark/runner.py`. A recommend way is to  build and deploy this docker container. 

You are welcome to submit your benchmark. Please create a new issue, your results will be listed here. Check out the [Contributing](https://github.com/zalandoresearch/fashion-mnist#contributing) section for details. Before submitting a benchmark, please make sure it is not listed [in this list](http://fashion-mnist.s3-website.eu-central-1.amazonaws.com/).
